      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Rhett Moxon. I refer to myself as a computer artist. I have worked as a graphic designer, web designer and 3d artist. I love the web and am an avid web user. I believe the web ranks at the top of the list of man's technological achievements,
        in the same space as things such as control of fire.</p>
      <p>In the 90’s before I owned a computer and before the invention of smart phones I thought it would be cool to make a website. Back then I had no idea how to do such a thing.</p>
      <p>When I went off to college to get my bachelors’ degree it turned out my school had some classes on web design and interactivity that I could take as electives and I did just that. These classes taught now outdated technologies and techniques but
        I did get to make my first website.</p>
      <p>Years later I now want to switch fulltime into web development and make what was once a hobby my career. </p>

      <h2>What's important to me</h2>
      <p>Enjoying life to the fullest is very important to me. I believe we only have one life to live and we better make the best of it. Everyday should be taken advantage of, though I’ll be the first to admit a day of complete sloth here and there can
        also be good.</p>
      <p>Family is important to me. Your family will always be your family. They will be the last ones standing with you when things are at their worst and thus your family deserves the utmost respect.</p>

      <h2>Where I'm from</h2>
      <p>I was born in the cold windy city of Chicago and raised in sunny St. Augustine Florida. I was blessed to grow up in St. Augustine, which is a small historic town on the Atlantic coast of Florida.</p>

      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Growing up in a small beach town in Florida you are exposed to surfing whether you’re interested in it or not. Being in a surf community you also have a lot of skateboarding, which is what I got involved with in middle school and high school. Towards
        the end of high school I started dabbling with surfing and later got hooked. When there are no waves the next best thing is being out on the water fishing.</p>

      <h2 id="music">Music I've been listening to</h2>
      <p>I used to listen to A LOT of hip-hop. I enjoy what you might call b-boy hip-hop; graffiti, break dancing, scratch dj’ing. There were more acts in the 90’s, when I grew up, that came from this sort of background, but now there is really none left
        in the large hip-hop music industry so I stopped following it.</p>
      <p>Now I listen to mostly electronic music. I try not to get involved with the platitude of different electronic music naming conventions because it always seemed silly to me.</p>
